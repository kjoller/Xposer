## Problem
We would like to watch for services running in our cluster; and create Ingresses and generate TLS certificates automatically (optional)

## Solution

Xposer can watch for all the services running in our cluster; Creates, Updates, Deletes Ingresses and uses certmanager to generate TLS certificates automatically based on some annotations.

## Deploying to Kubernetes

Xposer works perfectly fine with default properties. You can however provide custom propeties to change values accordingly

### Vanialla Manifests

You can apply vanilla manifests by running the following command

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Xposer/master/deployments/kubernetes/xposer.yaml
```

Xposer by default looks for Services only in the namespace where it is deployed, but it can be managed to work globally, you would have to change the KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE environment variable to "" in the above manifest. e.g. change KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE section to:

```
   - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
     value: ""
```

In Role `xposer-role` change  

```
kind: Role
```

to 

```
kind: ClusterRole
```

In RoleBinding `xposer-role-binding` change

```
kind: RoleBinding
roleRef:
  kind: Role
```

to

```
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
```

If you want Xposer to expose service URLs globally you also need to do the following:

In Role `xposer-configmap-role` change

```
kind: Role
```

to 

```
kind: ClusterRole
```

In RoleBinding `xposer-configmap-role-binding` change

```
kind: RoleBinding
roleRef:
  kind: Role
```

to 

```
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
```

### Helm Charts

Alternatively if you have configured helm on your cluster, you can add Xposer to helm from our public chart repository and deploy it via helm using below mentioned commands

```
helm repo add stakater https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts

helm repo update

helm install stakater/xposer
```

By default Xposer runs in a single namespace where it is deployed. To make Xposer watch all namespaces change the following flag to `true` in `values.yaml` file 

```
  watchGlobally: true
```

By default Xposer exposes service URLs locally (service's namespace). To make Xposer expose service URLs globally (in all namespaces) change the following flag to `globally` in `values.yaml` file
```
  exposeServiceURL: globally
```

## How to use Xposer

### Config
The default config of Xposer is located at /configs/config.yaml

```
domain: stakater.com
ingressURLTemplate: "{{.Service}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}"
ingressURLPath: /
ingressNameTemplate: "{{.Service}}"
tls: false
defaultBackend: true
```

Each property is explained below in details

For Xposer to  work on your service, it must have a label "expose = true"

```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
```

### Kubernetes

#### Ingresses

Xposer reads the following annotations from a service
```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
  annotations:
    xposer.stakater.com/annotations: |-
       firstAnnotation : abc
       secondAnnotation: abc
       thirdAnnotation: abc
```
`xposer.stakater.com/annotations` accepts annotations in new line. All the annotations provided here will be forwarded to Ingress as it is.

```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
  annotations:
    config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressNameTemplate: "{{.Service}}-{{.Namespace}}"
    config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLTemplate: "{{.Service}}.{{.Domain}}"
    config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLPath: "/"
    config.xposer.stakater.com/Domain: domain.com
    config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS: "true"
```
The above 5 annotations are used to generate Ingress, if not provided default annotations from /configs/config.yaml will be used. 3 variables used are:

| Variables        | Purpose           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `{{.Service}}` | Name of the service which is created/updated |
| `{{.Namespace}}` | Namespace in which service is created/updated |
| `{{.Domain}}` | Value from the annotation `config.xposer.stakater.com/Domain` or default domain from /configs/config.yaml file|

The below 5 annotations are for the following purpose:

| Annotations        | Purpose           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressNameTemplate` | With this annotation we can templatize generated Ingress Name. We can use the following template variables as well {{.Service}}, {{.Namespace}}. Can not include domain in Ingress name. | 
| `config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLTemplate` | With this annotation we can templatize generated Ingress URL/Hostname. We can use all 3 variables to templatize it |
| `config.xposer.stakater.com/IngressURLPath` | With this annotation we can specify Ingress Path |
| `config.xposer.stakater.com/Domain` | With this annotation we can specify domain| 
| `config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS` | With this annotation we can specify wether to use certmanager and generate a TLS certificate or not | 

#### Exposing public URL of service

Xposer provides support for exposing service's public Url in the form of configmaps. By default it exposes URLs locally (in the same namespace where service is created/updated). Whenever a service is created/updated/deleted, it updates the configmap `xposer` with the Ingress URL of the service. To make it work globally (in all namespaces) please check the following section *Deploying to Kubernetes* to configure Xposer

On each service which is being exposed by Xposer, we need to add the following annotation under the xposer annotations (The annotations which are forwarded to Ingress)

```
xposer.stakater.com/annotations: |-
   exposeIngressUrl: [locally or globally]
```

The above annotation can have 2 values; `globally` or `locally`. Any other value will be discarded.

In case `exposeIngressUrl` was set `globally`, a config-map with name `xposer` will be created in all the namespaces with data like this: 

| Key        | Value           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `[created-service-name]`-`[created-service-namespace]` | Ingress host of created service | 


In case `exposeIngressUrl` was set `locally`, a config-map with name `xposer` will be created only in the current namespace where service is being created/updated

| Key        | Value           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `[created-service-name]`-`[created-service-namespace]` | Ingress host of created service | 

In case the service is deleted, they key is removed from configmap

#### Certmanager (Optional)

First of all you need to install `certmanager`, and a `Issuer/ClusterIssuer` in your cluster. Xposer only needs 2 annotations to generate TLS certificates

```bash
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    expose: 'true'
  annotations:
    config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS: "true"
    xposer.stakater.com/annotations: |-
       certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer: your-cluster-issuer-name
```

The above example use cluster issuer `certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer:` annotation which will be forwaded to the ingress as it is with the installed issuer/cluster issuer name. 

The second annotation `config.xposer.stakater.com/TLS:` tells Xposer to add TLS information to the Ingress so it can communicate with the certmanager to generate certificates

### Openshift

Support for openshift routes will be added soon
